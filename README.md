# QuickSetup
This app meant to help **you** organizing an multiple installation folders - mostly for offline usage.

# Why
There are already many great tools solving almost the exact problem.
but unfortunately, each one of them has some different prespective of the main issue.
That's why I've created this tool.

# Basic Idea
It's is a (simple) GUI tool which lets you the end-user to decide how to detect if a software is installed.
you can do that by specifying a file and/or a registry key/value.
if the file exists with the same hash you chose, it will be marked as installed.
So, you - the end-user, will decide what exactly you want to install, and how to detect if it's already installed.
it could be a bounch of Games/Apps/Windows Settings - anything you like!

# Note
This tool will create a small JSON file in each folder you want to manage with the app details. 
It is a plain-text file, and you can see and edit the content by yourself if you desire (but you don't have to) :-)

# What it isn't
* This tool does NOT contain a database with other software information.
* This tool is NOT trying to compete great tools such as Ninite/Chocolatey or others.

# Questions/Suggestions
If you have any question/suggestion, I'll be more than happy to assist. 
please create an issue and I'll try to respond ASAP.

Thanks, and enjoy :-)
